# Adyen for Platforms sample application

## Intro

Adyen for Platforms is an end-to-end payment solution for peer-to-peer marketplaces, on-demand services, crowdfunding platforms, and any other platform business models.

This sample application is a simplified version of a platform built on top of AfP, supporting the following use cases:
* signup and start Hosted Onboarding
* login and resume Hosted Onboarding

The frontend is implemented in React, the backend is in Java (Spring Boot) leveraging the Adyen Java library 
([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-java-api-library) | [Documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries?tab=java_2)).

## Requirements

- [Adyen API Credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials/)
- Java 17
- Network access to Maven central

## 1. Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-afp-sample.git
```

## 2. Set the environment variables
* [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
* [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)
* [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure)
* [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

On Linux/Mac/Windows export/set the environment variables.
```shell
export BCL_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export LEM_API_KEY=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
export HOSTED_ONBOARDING_THEME_ID=yourHmacKey
```

Alternatively, it's possible to define the variables in the `application.properties`.
```txt
# API KEY for accessing Balance Platform Configuration API
BCL_API_KEY=

# API KEY for accessing LEM API
LEM_API_KEY=

# HMAC key to authenticate incoming webhook requests
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=

# Id of the Hosted Onboarding Theme created in the Customer Area
HOSTED_ONBOARDING_THEME_ID=
```

## 3. Run the application

#### Run Java and React
Run separately frontend and backend:
```shell
cd react-app
npm start
```

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Access [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

#### Build the application
Build SpringBoot jar packaging the entire application and run it:
```   
mvn package
java -jar target/adyen-afp-sample.jar
```

Access [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) 

# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications about the payment status and other events that are important to receive and process.
You can find more information about webhooks in [this blog post](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/consuming-webhooks).

### Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:
* **AUTHORISATION**


To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
